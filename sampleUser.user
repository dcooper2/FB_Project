/* 
*Contains all the info that is possible to have in one file. Because of how wall and photoAlbum 
*are set up we'll need to make 3 subdirectories: username.wall, username.photos, and username.inbox.
*Ideally they'll both be in the WEB-INF/lib directory. The reason we need a directory for the photos 
*instead of just having the urls is because users might try to upload a photo with the same 
*file name as another user (which is something I know Stephen is looking to take points off for)
