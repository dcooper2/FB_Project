Facebook Final Project for CPSC330

Things we have to do to get a B:

- New users can register to create new accounts, providing an email address and a password with which they can log in.
- Profile page with: name, birthdate, gender, current "status," profile picture, and hobbies. All these fields are editable
- Can request to be friends: Being someone's friend means (1) you will show up in the "Friends list" on their profile page and vice versa, and (2) you will be allowed to post on their Wall, and vice versa.
- Each person has a wall (not a news feed)
- Persistent storage of info


General notes:
- session User will be referred to as "LoginUser" when attemption to .getAttribute(), but the variable can be renamed as you like as long as its consistent throughout that jsp
- cannot add new wall posts on profile.jsp due to missing post.jsp
