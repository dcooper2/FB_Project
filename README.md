Facebook Final Project for CPSC330

Things we have to do to get a B:

New users can register to create new accounts, providing an email address and a password with which they can log in.
Profile page with: name, birthdate, gender, current "status," profile picture, and hobbies. All these fields are editable
Can request to be friends: Being someone's friend means (1) you will show up in the "Friends list" on their profile page and vice versa, and (2) you will be allowed to post on their Wall, and vice versa.
Each person has a wall (not a news feed)
Persistent storage of info
